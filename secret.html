<body style="text-align: center; padding-top: 50px;">
        <h1> hey, you found my super secret page  :)</h1>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">if you're reading this, thanks for taking a look at my website! However... I bet that no one else but me ever will be able to see this page, sadly. But in the very slim chance someone out in the world somehow finds their way here at this very moment in time... wherever you are, thank you. It means the world to me <3<h3>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">
            its currently 2:16am on a slightly warm monday night of july 26th, 2022 as I am writing this. I had to get my mind off of some things so I decided to update my website, and somehow I ended up here, writing out my thoughts. It would be kinda embarassing if someone were to find this page, but oh well... 
            I hope you're doing well, reader. <br> I think I've really started to learn to focus on myself recently. I mean in the end we really only have ourselves... There may not always be someone there for comfort or security. What am I saying? Perhaps its time to go to sleep. Thank you reader, good night. I hope you learn to love yourself.
